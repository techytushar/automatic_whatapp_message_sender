# automatic_whatapp_message_sender
This python script uses Selenium framework of python and Whatsapp Web to send a message to your selected contacts desired number of times.
You will need to install Selenium and a webdriver of your choice to run this script. You also need to scan the QR Code with your Smartphone in order to LogIn to Whatsapp Web. 
Just run it using CMD then type the message you want to send, then type the number of times you want to send it and hit enter. Scan the QR Code and choose the person or group you want to send the message in (give your response in cmd) and leave the rest for selenium.
Feel free to contact for any improvements.
